SILENT COMICS is an experiment to prototype, design, and publish *wordless comics*.
Online comics should be as reliable and brand-worthy as their counterpart printed edition.

Constraining the comics form[^1] but widening its reach, *SILENT COMICS* aims to re-explore a format with the continuity of [storyboards](https://film-storyboards.com) and [widescreen comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widescreen_comics).

About me: Illustrator & Designer, I started this project for the sake of doing something different than client work.

The [blog](https://silentcomics.com/notes/) is a compilation of notes to share this project's slow progress with you.

Once ready, comics will appear [here](https://silentcomics.com/comics) and [there](https://silent-comics.com)!

> Do you love comics, but don’t feel like reading? — I’m drawing silent comics for you.
