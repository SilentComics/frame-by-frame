You are right, yes, this project is going super slow! I tend to work on a single project at a time, which make things even slower between freelancing gigs. I’m working on a way to speed up things a little though, not 100% there yet. That’s why it wouldn’t be wise to set a release date right now. You can get on the email list to get a small note when the first comics episodes are taking off. Rest assured that you won’t get any annoying marketing emails from me. If you are wondering about this project’s pace of development, and it does progress, you can always check the progress text file online:
