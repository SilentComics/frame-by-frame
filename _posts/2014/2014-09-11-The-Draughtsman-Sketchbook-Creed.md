*My Sketchbook*

This is my sketchbook. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My sketchbook is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.

My sketchbook, without me, is useless. Without my sketchbook, I am useless. I must sharpen my pencils true. I must draw faster than yesterday, before tomorrow kills me. I must draw everything before it draws me. I WILL...

My sketchbook and myself know that what counts in this life is not the rounds we trace, the noise of our nib, nor the dots we make. We know that it is the drawings that count. WE WILL DRAW…

My sketchbook is human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its leaves, its spine and its back cover. I will ever guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, my eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my sketchbook clean and ready. We will become part of each other. WE WILL...

Before my drawing peers, I swear this creed. My sketchbook and myself are the defenders of my integrity. We are the masters of our craft. WE ARE THE SAVIORS OF MY LIFE.

So be it, until victory is mine and there is no white page, but pictures!
